## Profile: ##

I'm passionate about: excellence, learning, and launching people to reach their full potential. When it comes to excellence, I decide to take the approach: work smarter and harder. I will not half do a job and I intend on getting things right the first time. By way of learning, I have a habit of taking on challenging projects to expand my understanding. I also really like solving problems. Additionally, I have a really good memory and can remember nearly everything I learn. For launching people into their potential, I am in my third year at a leadership school where I am currently an intern helping run the school. By doing things in excellence and developing people I intend to change the world around me.
